Hi Simon,

The good:

* It works and he followed 95% of the requirements.
* Comments
* Used simple JSON approach to save and load the data
* Noticed that the check all checkbox should be disabled when not all are marked

The bad:

* Way too much code in my opinion & difficult to understand - everything is laid out as a script and not well organized
* React is over used here in my opinion.
* There is no Customer or Person class  (we sepcificly requested this in the ex.) - not true MVC or MVVM (I'm expecting for a VM class that manipulates the logic. everything is jut laid out there)
* Validation done manually (why not use a library?)
* Data stored in local storage and not cookie as requested in the comments of the ex. (not that important)
* Doesn't work in Edge IE (didn't deep dive into why)

Conclusion:

lets' talk :)

I think I did a very good job on this example,

The man that evaluated my work was expecting angular.js. 

My comments:

* Way too much code in my opinion & difficult to understand - everything is laid out as a script and not well organized
 * This the way rect.js works.  It's only script, no html. React.js is not Angular.js.
 * If you want Angular.js? I will happyly do it :). 
 * However I'm very happy and surprised with the tight integration of the UI to the ViewModel React.js is giving.
 * React enabled me to create great user expirience in a simple and easy manner
* React.js is over used here in my opinion
 * Again this not Angular.js. there is no other things like html.
* There is no Customer or Person class  (we sepcificly requested this in the ex.)
 * It was not clear from the requirements.
 * was written:
  * "Have the user be represented by WhatEver"
* not a true MVC or MVVM (I'm expecting for a VM class that manipulates the logic. everything is jut laid out there)
 * MVC architecture was not required. If it was requires I would have done it.
 * React is not mvc its just V or ViewModel as I have done.
 * Was written:
  * "You are welcome to use any popular familiar JS frameworks"
  * "the specific framework semantics is less relevant"
* Validation done manually (why not use a library?)
 * If you want a library, i am happy to do it :) There were few candidates, then I decided to not use them. for several reasons:
 * to not add uncececery code to simple file of all-in-one file of coding demonstration.
 * What I have done works well. 
 * what i have doe is it is simple and with better integartion.
* Data stored in local storage and not cookie as requested in the comments of the ex. (not that important)
 * When I asked Zaar by phone what do you want me to do, he answered: Do whatether you think would it be best for us.
 * Cookies are bad because, cookies are sent across http and this might be bad andmight slow down every single http request including images, needlessly transmitting large amount of data 
* Doesn't work in Edge IE (didn't deep dive into why)
 * It works in IE11/edge just tested myself, works well
 * It jsut needs to be used from http server, not works in IE as file from disk.
