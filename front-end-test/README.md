The good:

* It works and he followed 95% of the requirements.
* Comments
* Used simple JSON approach to save and load the data
* Noticed that the check all checkbox should be disabled when not all are marked

The bad:

* Way too much code in my opinion & difficult to understand - everything is laid out as a script and not well organized
* React is over used here in my opinion.
* There is no Customer or Person class  (we sepcificly requested this in the ex.) - not true MVC or MVVM (I'm expecting for a VM class that manipulates the logic. everything is jut laid out there)
* Validation done manually (why not use a library?)
* Data stored in local storage and not cookie as requested in the comments of the ex. (not that important)
* Doesn't work in Edge IE (didn't deep dive into why)

Conclusion:

lets' talk :)

I think there ware I did a very job on this example,
The man that evaluated my work was expecting angular.js. 

My comments:

* Way too much code in my opinion & difficult to understand - everything is laid out as a script and not well organized" 
 * this way rect.js works it is only script, no html, react.js is not angular.js,
 * if you want angular js? i happyly to do it :). 
 * however i'm very happy and surprised with the tight integration of the ui to the view model react.js is giving.
 * react enabled me to create great user expirience in a simple and easy manner
* React is over used here in my opinion
 * again this not angular.js there is no other things like html.
* There is no Customer or Person class  (we sepcificly requested this in the ex.)
 * it was not required.
 * was written "Have the user be represented by WhatEver"
* not a true MVC or MVVM (I'm expecting for a VM class that manipulates the logic. everything is jut laid out there)
 * MVC architecture was not required. if it was requires i would have done it.
 * react is not mvc its just v or VM view model as i done
 * was written: "You are welcome to use any popular familiar JS frameworks" "the specific framework semantics is less relevant"
* Validation done manually (why not use a library?)
 * if you want a library, i am happy to do it :) there ware few candidates, i decided to not use.
 * to not add uncececery code to simple file of all-in-one demo-of-coding
 * what i have done works well. it is simple and with better integartion.
* Data stored in local storage and not cookie as requested in the comments of the ex. (not that important)
 * when i asked Zaar by phone do you want me to do, he answered: do what you think would it be best for us
 * cookies are bad because, cookies are sent across http and this might be bad andmight slow down every single http request including images, needlessly transmitting large amount of data 
* Doesn't work in Edge IE (didn't deep dive into why)
 * it works in IE11/edge just tested myself, works well
 * it jsut needs to be used from http server, not works in IE as file from disk.
